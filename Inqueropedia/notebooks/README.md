# Notebooks

All the python notebooks related to the model development process. Most of the code is run here for min-testing and converted into scripts.

NOTE: `preprocessing.ipynb` is the latest preprocessing notebook. Other 'preprocessing' notebooks will be not be in use for future commits and/or models. (This is due to the change in train-dataset).
